# Chinese OCR and Translation
This Python script uses the OCR.space API to recognize Chinese text from an input image and saves the recognized text to a text file. The text file will have the same base name as the input image and will be saved in the same folder as the script.

## Usage
Replace the API key in the image_to_text function with your own OCR.space API key.
Set the image_path variable to the path of the input image containing Chinese text.
Run the script: python chinese_ocr.py

## Example
set your image_path, for example image_path = r'D:\Tools\Chinese-OCR\test.png'
run the script and the result is in test.txt
